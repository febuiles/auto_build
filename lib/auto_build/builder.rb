      # Public: This method allows you to auto initialize associations
      # in your models. After calling it you don't need to call
      # `build_association` or `association.build` in your controllers
      # or views. Useful for models that accept nested attributes for
      # associations. It **does not** overwrite associations with
      # existing values.
      #
      # An `after_initialize` hook will be created for each one of
      # the associations.
      #
      # Signature
      #
      #   auto_build(<field>, <field>, <field>)
      #   auto_build(<field>, <options>)
      #
      # field   - A Symbol with the name of the association you want
      #           initialize
      # options - A Hash with the options to initialize the
      #           associations. See AutoBuilder::Association#initialize
      #           for the options.
      #
      # Examples
      #
      #     class User
      #       has_one :address
      #       has_many :pictures
      #       has_many :projects
      #     end
      #
      #     auto_build :address, :pictures
      #     # => Builds a record for each association if none is present
      #
      #     auto_build :projects, :count => 3
      #     # => Builds 3 projects each time you initialize a User
      #
      #     auto_build :pictures, :append => true
      #     # => Builds an extra Picture each time you initialize a User
