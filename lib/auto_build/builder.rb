      # Public: This method allows you to auto initialize `has_one` associations
      # in your models. After calling it you don't need to call
      # `build_association` in your controllers or views. Useful for models
      # that accept nested attributes for associations. It **does not** ovewrite
      # associations with existing values.
      #
      # An `after_initialize` hook will be created for each one of
      # the associations.
      #
      # associations - A symbol or array with the associations you want to build
      #
      # Examples
      #
      #     class User
      #       has_one :address
      #       has_one :phone
      #       auto_build :address, :phone
      #     end
      #
